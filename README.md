### programming
i'm a fulltime junior software engineer but i do web development as a hobby! still starting out, for the most part, but you can check out my non-framework pages on [neocities](https://aglovale.neocities.org/).

**languages i use, in preferential order:**
- html, css, js
- react, node.js, angular
- c++
- python
- java
- c#

### ponytown
if you're here for ponytown reasons, i have no interaction requirements! just be respectful and i'll do my best to be around for it. i'm still learning since i don't go online often, but if you give me a crown please know i'm extremely happy to receive regardless of response. ðŸ’š

my skins are usually of comfort characters; i do kin but i never make ponies of my kins. feel free to use as inspiration, i don't mind either way.
